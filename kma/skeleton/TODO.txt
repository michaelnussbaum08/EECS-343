Add counter to our size list data structure so we know when we need to free and
malloc the control page. We can keep the counter in a 0 size entry on the size
table.

Then we need to write our own free and malloc that we use instead of the system
malloc/free where we only use memory from our control page. We can use this
across algorithms.
