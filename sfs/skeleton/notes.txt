Resume with debugging add_dentry for file file00000

Superblock has free inode pointer and 250 byte (2000 bit) bitmap


inodes are each 32 bytes and go on for 52 blocks (room for 912 entries) starting
from root

dentry struct -- char[16] (17?) and inode*
We can store 25 dentries in a block, so expand to multiple blocks if
necessary, NULL terminate after last entry

Static open file linked list
Each entry has:
    *inode
    id
    *next_entry
