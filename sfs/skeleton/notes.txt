We need bitmap that is 2000 bits long, so it'll have to span four sectors.
Superblock has free sector count and pointers, free inode count and occupied inode pointers
Keep static pointer to open file table of open files objects (which have pointers to inodes

To design:
inode structs
open file structs
Directory structs
File on disk structs
